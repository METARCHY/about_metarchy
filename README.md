# About Metarchy

Metarchy is an open-source online game that is based on Cosmos SDK and Massa Network. 
It features microeconomics, opponent prediction, and outcome betting.
Players can participate in championships and choose their own sponsors. Metarchy is the first game on the Game Metaverse Platform, which will include several games with single user accounts (Connect Wallet).
The platform’s games are easy to understand, making it accessible to even inexperienced players.
The platform’s NFTs can be used in any game on the platform, enabling cross-gaming.

## MISSION
Metarchy was created by a group of crypto-enthusiasts of the Cosmos Ecosystem and our mission is to develop the Ecosystem, attract new members to it, show the simplicity and convenience of the Ecosystem!

We want to distribute governance of games between creators and players through consensus. Immerse players in the gameplay and test the technologies of the future.

## FOUNDATION

### Openness
We are technically and humanitarianly open!
We are PermissionLess!
Any player can join the game, communicate directly with the developers, and influence the further development of the Game!

### Decentralized Governance
Metarchy will be governed not only by developers, but by all players!
What’s more, the community of players will be able to modify and evolve the game by creating and voting on proposals!
Decentralized Governance will allow the game to be always up to date, and adapt to dynamic conditions.

### Customization
Various player customizations can be done with the NFT.
However, we decided to expand the capabilities of in-game NFTs so that they can change not only the character, but also the game interface, location themes.
Thanks to the CosmWasm interchain smart contracts, it becomes possible to customize one game by customizing another game.

### Gaming Interdependence
Since the initial strategy is to create a game universe consisting of many games, then some NFTs will be cross-project and can be created in one project and used in several.
This will encourage players to participate in new games, as well as make their gameplay easier.

### GameFi
Our game metaverse will use multi-game mechanics that combine:
- Win-to-Earn (to get a reward, you need to win, not just play)
- Learn-to-Earn (the ability to gain new skills and educate yourself while receiving a reward)
- Gamification of DeFi

## TOKENOMICS
The tokenomics of the game will be implemented in the following way:
- Game Token will be created, which will be used as a reward for winning
- Game Token can be exchanged on DEX, or held and used as a governance token, to vote on game upgrades and championship sponsors

Scheme:

Players are interested in the gameplay and winning in the game.
Sponsors are interested in promoting their project among the target audience.
Players vote for sponsors, which makes it clear to sponsors that those who voted for them are the target audience, in other words, players choose those who will advertise product or service.
Sponsors redeem part of Game Tokens and create a liquidity pool (Sponsors Tokens with Game Tokens), after it they receive marketing services.
For example: creating game skins with the symbols of the project, and providing information about the project among the gaming community.
Players compete and the winners receive Game Tokens, which they can either exchange in the liquidity pool for Sponsors Tokens.
Or, Players can hold Game Tokens and use them to vote for future sponsors. Future sponsors will add their tokens to the capitalization of Game Tokens, which will increase the value of Game Tokens.
This will motivate some of the Players to hold Game Tokens.
Additional value of the gaming metaverse lies in the fact that it will be created on the blockchain, which will also have its own economic, social and technical components:


## GAMEPLAY
### Turn-based strategy, predictions, bets.
Metarchy is a mixture of board game and rock-paper-scissors.

Full rules will be published soon! We will add link on full rules here!

Players must proceed not only from their own actions, but also to anticipate the actions of other players.
Also, players can bet on the outcome of events, which will confirm or refute their predictions of the actions of other players.

### Microeconomics
Players must constantly keep track of resources in order to gain victory points, while preventing other players from getting ahead.

### Diplomacy
Players can exchange some resources with each other, while they must proceed not only from personal gain, but also in such a way as not to play along with opponents. For example: sometimes it is more profitable not to make an exchange than to make an exchange.

### Game World
The game takes place in the near future, where most of the problems are solved by mass robotization.
At the same time, human nature hasn’t undergone drastic changes.
The main human values that couldn’t be robotized: Knowledge, Art and Power.
Material resources began to play a secondary role, but at the same time they are still necessary for the functioning of society.

Metarchy gives players a positive and constructive view of the world, while warning of potential problems that will not disappear even if labor is fully automated.
Metarchy will enable players to look at the world not dually, but trially, making it clear that the world is not only “black and white”.

## Positioning
The first board game on the blockchain with innovative game mechanics and logic.
A mixture of poker logic with rock-paper-scissors, giving equal opportunities to both lucky and mathematically advanced players.
Unlike other games based on the mechanics of loot boxes and Play-to-Earn, Metarchy gives equal opportunities to everyone from the very beginning, and its simple rules are accessible even to inexperienced players.
This is a great opportunity to spend time with any friends, as well as earn money.

## Target Group
1. Users of the Cosmos Ecosystem who are interested in new projects.
2. Players who want to make money using the W2E opportunities of blockchain games.
3. Ordinary people who want to spend time with friends playing games using a computer and are looking for something simple and understandable for everyone.
