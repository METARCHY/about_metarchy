# Metarchy: Official Rulebook

Welcome to the official rules for **Metarchy**, a turn-based strategy game of hidden information, psychological deduction, and resource management.

## 🎯 Goal of the Game
The ultimate objective is to accumulate the highest number of **Victory Points** by the end of the game's final Turn. 
A **Victory Point** is earned by collecting a full set of the three Value Tokens:
`1 Victory Point = 1 Power + 1 Art + 1 Knowledge`

If players have an equal number of Victory Points at the end of the final Turn, an extra tie-breaker Turn is played between those tied players.

## 🔬 Game Components

### 1. Players
The game supports 2 to 3 players, or "2 vs. 2" mode.

### 2. The Game Board (Locations)
The board consists of 6 distinct Locations where Conflicts are happening:
**Human Locations:**
- 🏛️ **University** (You can send here Politician or Scientist)
- 🎭 **Theater** (You can send here Scientist or Artist)
- ⛲ **Square** (You can send here Politician or Artist)

**Robot Locations:**
- 🏭 **Factory** (You can send here Robot)
- ⚡ **Energy Plant** (You can send here Robot)
- 🗑️ **Dump** (You can send here Robot)

### 3. Actors (4 Types per Player)
Actors are sent to Locations to create values.
- 👔 **Politician** (Players can only send Politician to the Square and University locations.)
A Politician in the Square or University location creates the Value - Power Token.
If two or more Politicians are in the Square or University location, a Conflict occurs between the Politicians.
A Conflict between Politicians is resolved via a quick Rock-Scissors-Paper resolution: Those who Win - stay in the location, those who Lose - leave the location.
If a Conflict between Politicians results in a Draw, resolve the Conflict again via a quick Rock-Scissors-Paper resolution. This continues until only one Politician remains in the location.
Only the player who owns the Politician remaining in the location receives the Value - Power Token.
- 🧑🔬 **Scientist** (Players can only send Scientist to the Theater and University Locations.)
A Scientist in the Theater or University Location produces the Value - Knowledge Token.
If two or more Scientists are in the Theater or University Location, a Conflict occurs between the Scientists.
A Conflict between Scientists is resolved via a quick Rock-Scissors-Paper resolution: Those who Win - stay in the location, those who Lose - leave the location.
If a Conflict between Scientists results in a Draw, all Scientists Actors remain in the Location, and the Conflict no longer occurs.
All Players who own Actor - Scientist remaining in the Location receive the Value - Knowledge Token.
- 🧑🎨 **Artist** (Players can only send Artist to the Theater and Square Locations.)
An Artist in the Theater or Square Location creates the Value - Art Token.
If two or more Artists are in the Theater or Square Location, a Conflict occurs between the Artists.
A Conflict between Artists is resolved via a quick Rock-Scissors-Paper resolution: Those who Win - stay in the location, those who Lose - leave the location.
If a Conflict between Artists results in a Draw, all Actors and Artists leave the Location, and players don't receive the Value - Art Token.
- 🤖 **Robot** (Players can send an Actor-Robot to any of three Locations: Factory, Power Plant, or Dump.
A Robot in the Factory Location produces three units of rescourses - Product.
A Robot in the Power Plant Location produces three units of rescourses - Electricity.
A Robot in the Dump Location produces three units of rescourses - Recycling.
If two or more Actor-Robots are in the Factory, Power Plant, or Dump Location, a Conflict occurs between the Robots.
A Conflict between Robots is resolved via a quick Rock-Scissors-Paper resolution: Those who Win - stay in the location, those who Lose - leave the location.
If a Conflict between Robots is resolved with a Draw, all Actor-Robots remain in the Location, and the Conflict no longer occurs and players who own Actors - Robots that remain in the Location - receive rescourses - Product/Electricity/Recycling (depending on the Location), but in the amount of one unit, not three units.)

### 4. Arguments / RSP-Tokens (4 Types)
Every Actor needs to have an Argument when is sent to a Location. Other players don't knowwhich Actors and which Argument you chose.
- 🪨 **Rock** *(Loses to Paper. Wins against Scissors and Dummy. Draws against Rock).*
- ✂️ **Scissors** *(Loses to Rock. Wins against Paper and Dummy. Draws against Scissors).*
- 📄 **Paper** *(Loses to Scissors. Wins against Rock and Dummy. Draws against Paper).*
- 🪆 **Dummy** *(Loses to Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Draws against another Dummy).*

### 5. Value Tokens (Non-Material)
Required to form Victory Points.
- 👑 **Power** (Won by Politics in Square/University)
- 🎨 **Art** (Won by Artists in Theater/Square)
- 📖 **Knowledge** (Won by Scientists in University/Theater)
- ⭐ **Fame** (You can win it in event phase. Can be used as a joker. Can play the role of any other Value Token.)

### 6. Resource Tokens
Used to place bets on conflicts and to purchase Action cards.
- ⚙️ **Production** (Used to bet on "Win". If Actor wins the Conflict resolution, the Player will receive one additional Value Token or one additional Resource Token depending on the Actor the Player bid on.)
- 🔋 **Electricity** (Used to bet on "Lose". If Actor loses in resolving the Conflict, the Conflict resolution need to be done one more time.)
- ♻️ **Recycling** (Used to bet on "Draw". If the Conflict resolution ends in a Draw, then Actor will win the Conflict resolution.)

### 7. Action Cards
Action cards are powerful, single-use items that can dramatically alter the game state. They are purchased during Phase 5 using a combination of Resource Tokens.
  Deck of Action Cards contains 15 cards:
- **Construction Work** (1 card. Location Square doesn't work this turn. No conflicts will happen there)
- **Reconstruction** (1 card. Location Theater doesn't work this turn. No conflicts will happen there)
- **Student Protests** (1 card. Location University doesn't work this turn. No conflicts will happen there)
- **Sabotage** (1 card. Location Factory doesn't work this turn. No conflicts will happen there)
- **Cable Stolen** (1 card. Location Energy Plant doesn't work this turn. No conflicts will happen there)
- **Environmental Protests** (1 card. Location Dump doesn't work this turn. No conflicts will happen there)
- **Relocation** (6 cards. Choose one actor and move it to any possible location. You can't send Politics to Theater, Scientist to Square, Artist to University, Robots to Human Locations, and Humans to Robot Locations. You can play Relocation card after any player played Construction Work, Reconstruction, Student Protests, Sabotage, Cable Stolen, or Environmental Protests)
- **Value Change** (3 cards. Exchange one of your non-material value tokens with any other non-material value token. But you can't exchange the Fame token)

- A player may play an Action Card during the Action Phase.
- Players always receive Action Cards randomly.
- An Action Card can be obtained randomly by playing an Event Card.
- In the last phase of each turn, a player can purchase a random Action Card using three different Resources: "Product + Electricity + Recycling."

### 8. Event Cards
At the beginning of each turn, in Phase 1, (But not on turn 1) one of the seven Event Cards is randomly drawn.
Deck of Event Cards contains 7 cards:
- **Political Repression** (Players compare the amount of Power Tokens. The player with the lowest amount of Power Tokens gains the Fame Token.)
- **Educational Crisis** (Players compare the amount of Knowledge Tokens. The player with the lowest amount of Knowledge Tokens gains the Fame Token.)
- **Cultural Decline** (Players compare the amount of Art Tokens. The player with the lowest amount of Art Tokens gains the Fame Token.)
- **Revolution** (Players compare the amount of all Intangible Value Tokens. The player with the lowest amount of all Intangible Value Tokens gains the Fame Token.)
- **Help Poor Countries** (Each Player discards any amount of Product Tokens, but players don't know how many resources other players discarded. After all Players have discarded the desired number of Product Tokens (the desired number may be zero), information about how many resources each player has discarded becomes publicly known. The number of Product Tokens discarded is compared. The Player who has discarded more Product Tokens receives a random Action Card.)
- **Earth Hour** (Each Player discards any amount of Electricity Tokens, but players don't know how many resources other players discarded. After all Players have discarded the desired amount of Electricity Tokens (the desired number may be zero), information about how many resources each player has discarded becomes publicly known. The number of Electricity Tokens discarded is compared. The Player who has discarded more Electricity Tokens receives a random Action Card.)
- **Prevent Eco-Crisis** (Each Player discards any amount of Recycling Tokens, but players don't know how many resources other players discarded. After all Players have discarded the desired number of Recycling Tokens (the desired number may be zero), information about how many resources each player has discarded becomes publicly known. The number of Recycling Tokens discarded is compared. The Player who has discarded more Recycling Tokens receives a random Action Card.)

If two or more players meet the conditions specified on the Event Card, the winner is determined by automatically drawing from the players' pre-committed **Argument Queue** (a sequence of RSP Arguments used instantly to resolve ties without halting the game).

## ⏳ Game Flow & Phases
Depending on the player count, the game spans a specific number of Turns:
- **2 Players:** 6 Turns
- **3 Players:** 6 Turns
- **4 Players (2vs2):** Short game 4 Turns, Long game 8 Turns


Every Turn is divided into **5 Phases**, completed in order:

### 1️⃣ Phase 1 - Event (Starts from Turn 2)
An **Event Card** is randomly revealed from the deck. Players must react based on the card's text. 
- Players may need to secretly discard Resource tokens. The player who discards the most wins an **Action Card**.
- Players may compare their Non-Material Value tokens. The player with the fewest tokens receives a **Fame** token.
*(Note: If players tie, the winner is decided via a quick Rock-Scissors-Paper resolution).*

### 2️⃣ Phase 2 - Distribution
This is a hidden information phase. All players simultaneously distribute their Actors.
- Players assign their 4 Actors to various Locations on the board.
- Each Actor MUST be paired with an **Argument Queue** (a sequence of 3 RSP-Tokens). The first one is the active Argument. The second and third are reserves used automatically by the game server if a tie or a re-roll occurs.


### 3️⃣ Phase 3 - Bets
All **Actors** and their **Locations** are revealed. (The *Arguments/RSP-Tokens* remain hidden).
- Players can now see where Conflicts will occur (A Conflict happens when two or more Actors of same type end up in the same Location).
- Players may optionally attach **Resource Tokens** to their Actors as a hidden "Bet on the Conflict Outcome".
Nobody knows which Arguments are on the Actors. Player can add only one bet on each Actor

### 4️⃣ Phase 4 - Actions
All **Actors** and their **Locations** are revealed. (The *Arguments/RSP-Tokens and Bets* remain hidden).
- All players simultaneously commit which Action Cards they wish to play (they can play any amount of cards).
- After all commits are locked, the game automatically executes the Action Cards in the following strict priority sequence:
  1. **Block Locations First:** Construction Work, Reconstruction, Student Protests, Sabotage, Cable Stolen, Environmental Protests take effect.
  2. **Relocations Second:** Actors are moved (useful for escaping blocked Locations).
  3. **Value Exchanges Third:** Change Value Cards are executed to swap values based on the final board configuration.

### 5️⃣ Phase 5 - Conflict & Resolution
Identifying Conflicts between Actors:
- If two or more Actors of the same type are in the same Location, a Conflict occurs between these Actors.
- All Actors involved in the Conflict reveal their Arguments (the 1st slot of their Argument Queue) and Bets.
- Conflicts between Actors can have "Win", "Draw" or "Loss" as a result.
- Then, the Bets are considered:
    - If the "Conflict Outcome" matches the Bet, the Bet is successful.
    - If the "Conflict Outcome" does not match the Bet, the Bet is unsuccessful.
    - An Actor not involved in a Conflict is considered the Winner in the Conflict resolution, and if a bet on a Win was placed on them, the bet is successful. However, if a bet on a Draw or Loss was placed on them, the bet is not successful.
    - All Resource Tokens used as "Conflict Outcome Bets" are not returned, regardless of the Conflict's outcome.
- **Victory:** The winning Actor survives and claims the Location's Reward (Value Tokens or Resource Tokens depending on the Actor type and Location).
- **Defeat:** Losing Actors are immediately removed from the Location.
- **Draw:** For Politicians: a resolution loop occurs instantly using the next Arguments in their **Argument Queue** (2nd, then 3rd) until only the Winners remain in the Location. (If an Electricity Bet forces a re-roll on any Actor, the queue is also used).
For Scientists: no needs to resolve, all Scientists remain in the location.
For Artists: no needs to resolve, all Artists leave the location.

Players recive Value Tokens for their Actors remaining in the Location, and Rescourse Tokens for Robots in the locations (3 units if there is only one robot, and only 1 unit if there are more than one robot)


### 6️⃣ Phase 6 - Exchange
Players may purchase items.
- Players may choose to spend Production + Electricity + Recycling Tokens (1 unit of each) to buy random Action Card from the deck.

The Turn ends immediately after Phase 6. And next turn starts from Phase 1.
If it was the final Turn, game ends after Phase 5, and players count their Victory Points to determine the ultimate winner!
